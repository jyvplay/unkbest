/**
 * N-Deep — persistent workspace override (Vite interceptor pattern).
 *
 * The base `runNDeep()` (real production adversarial refinement engine, used
 * directly by ChatApp.tsx's "⚡ N-Deep" toggle AND by lib/pipeline.ts's 4-Stage
 * Stage 3.5 routing) already benefits from the truncation gate added to
 * `./adversarial-engine.ts` (its per-pass critique step now correctly flags a
 * truncated draft as "revise" instead of a false "pass"). This closes most of
 * the truncation-slips-through-N-Deep gap for free.
 *
 * Residual gap: if the pass BUDGET is exhausted (`pass === cap`) while the
 * draft is STILL truncated, the base loop breaks with `stable: false` and
 * returns the truncated text as-is — the caller then ships it unchanged. Per
 * the standing product requirement ("always rewrite, never block/ship a
 * truncated answer"), this wrapper adds ONE bounded completion-repair call
 * that fires ONLY in that rare residual case, and is REJECTED (original text
 * kept) unless the repair is both longer and verifiably non-truncated —
 * a strict, monotonic, never-regress safety net. Purely additive: passes,
 * totalLlmCalls, fullRewrites, and the entire section-splice/tie-break/
 * core-rewrite algorithm are completely untouched.
